# Stellar x Web3bridge Security Challenge 2025

## Challenge Overview

The Stellar x Web3bridge Builders Weekend was a security-focused challenge where participants learned to build secure smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban. This challenge emphasized practical application of security best practices in smart contract development.

## Challenge Theme

**Soroban Smart Contract Security**

Participants were tasked with building secure, production-ready smart contracts while learning about:
- Common vulnerabilities and prevention techniques
- Security audit practices
- Industry-standard security implementations

## Project Options

Teams could choose from three curated project types or propose an approved idea aligned with the security theme. Each project required comprehensive integration testing.

### 1. Multi-Signature Wallet

Build a collaborative wallet with enhanced security features:

**Required Features:**
- Multi-signer management with configurable thresholds
- Transaction proposal and approval system
- Administrative controls and access management
- Secure signature verification

**Security Focus:** Access control, authorization patterns, signature validation

### 2. Escrow Contract

Develop a trustless escrow system for secure transactions:

**Required Features:**
- Trustless escrow mechanism for secure peer-to-peer transactions
- Conditional funds release with verification
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Milestone-based payments with automated release
- Refund capabilities with proper authorization

**Security Focus:** State management, fund locking, conditional logic validation

### 3. Time-locked Savings

Create a savings contract with time-based restrictions:

**Required Features:**
- Deposit locking for fixed/configurable periods
- Interest calculation and compounding mechanisms
- Emergency withdrawal with penalties
- Support for multiple savings goals per user

**Security Focus:** Time-based access control, arithmetic operations, withdrawal restrictions

## Requirements

   - Contract deployed to Stellar Testnet
   - Deployment details (contract address)

2. **Documentation:**
   - Project README

3. **Social Media:**
   - Twitter/X post about the project
   - Tag @BuildOnStellar & @Stellar_WA
   - Describe what you built and challenges faced

4. **Wallet Information:**
   - Stellar USDC wallet address for rewards

## Learning Objectives

Participants gained hands-on experience with:

1. **Stellar Development:**
   - Soroban smart contract development
   - Stellar network deployment

2. **Security Practices:**
